## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Sass

### What I learned

This project helped me to consolidate my react skills. I made this project while learning react. Working on this project helped me to understand the concepts of components, hooks and other react features in a better way.

### Continued development

- Some components can refactored.
- The design looks a bit odd for large tablets. Need to write media quesies for them.
